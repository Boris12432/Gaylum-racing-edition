# Networking
Godot 4 has added some awesome new networking functionality, and these projects explore it.
All of these are working with the Godot 4.0 stable release.

## [Basic](https://github.com/MitchReidNZ/Godot-Things/tree/main/Networking/Basic)
This is the most straightforward example, showing off the new MultiplayerSpawner and MultiplayerSynchronizer nodes. It only has a few lines of networking code, and no custom assets.

## [Explained](https://github.com/MitchReidNZ/Godot-Things/tree/main/Networking/Explained)
A more complex project, with some actual "gameplay" going on (Players can press buttons to increase the score!)

Builds on the Explained project even further, adding a main menu, shooting, and enemies to kill.

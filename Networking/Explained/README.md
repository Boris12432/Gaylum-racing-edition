# (Slightly) More advanced networking
A slightly more advanced version of the Basic networking tutorial.

> Note: These require an Alpha (#4 or newer) build of Godot 4. Being on the bleeding edge is painful, and if you're working on a serious project you probably want to stick with 3.X - in which case these experiments will not be useful to you.

## Youtube
For a video explanation, I've done a walkthrough on youtube - https://youtu.be/nQ4P3ogXp2Q

## Running
Edit the batch files in this folder, replacing the exe with the path to your godot executable.

Update the URL that the client connects to, so that it uses 'localhost'.

If you'd like to see the server-eye view, remove the `--headless` argument from the server batch file.
